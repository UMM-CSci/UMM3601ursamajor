            "The nails were placed in glass jars and added with 150mL of water mixed with 15mL of salt. The experiment was observed for two weeks. " +
            "The amount of rust was recorded on both types of nails. I repeated these steps for two types of nails in freshwater. " +

      abstract: "The relationship between habitat use by voles (Rodentia: Microtus) and the density of vegetative cover was studied to determine if voles select forage areas at the microhabitat level.  " +
          "Using live traps, I trapped, powdered, and released voles at 10 sites.  At each trap site I analyzed the type and height of the vegetation in the immediate area.  " +
          "Using a black light, I followed the trails left by powdered voles through the vegetation.  I mapped the trails using a compass to ascertain the tortuosity, or amount the trail twisted and turned, " +
          "and visually checked the trails to determine obstruction of the movement path by vegetation.  I also checked vegetative obstruction on 4 random paths near the actual trail, " +
          "to compare the cover on the trail with other nearby alternative pathways.  There was not a statistically significant difference between the amount of cover on a vole trail and the cover " +
          "off to the sides of the trail when completely covered; there was a significant difference between on and off the trail when the path was completely open.  " +
          "These results indicate that voles are selectively avoiding bare areas, while not choosing among dense patches at a fine microhabitat scale.",

          "MIPs are designed to bind the molecule that they have been imprinted with over other structurally similar molecules. " +
          "The goal of this project was to create a beta- Cyclodextrin (BCD) based MIP imprinted with the amino acid L-Phenylalanine (L-Phe) MIPs, " +
          "which are prepared based on relatively weak intermolecular attractions between the template molecule and pre-polymer components, have decreased binding abilities in polar solvents. " +
          "However, to be used in many practical applications in the future, MIPs will need to be able to function in polar solvents such as water. " +
          "In this project, the goal was to synthesize a MIP that could bind L-Phe in an aqueous solution by using the hydrophobic attraction provided by the B-CD cavity. " +
          "MIPs were formed by polymerizing (crosslinking) B-CD with m-xylylene disocyanate (XDI) in the presence of L-Phe (template molecule). " +
          "CuCl2 was used to increase the solubility of L-Phe in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, solvent). Control polymers were formed in the same way, but in the absence of L-Phe and CuCl2. " +
          "All polymers were thoroughly washed and dried to prepare them for rebinding studies and analysis. The polymer obtained from the synthesis described was analyzed with IR spectroscopy, " +

      title: "The Effect of Motor Oil on Daphnia magna",
      format: "Humanities Proposal",
      abstract: "The purpose of my project was to model how motor oil released to a lake impacts the organisms that live there. " +
          "Whole effluent toxicity (WET) testing is used by regulatory agencies to determine how clean an effluent must be before release to the environment. " +
          "In a WET test, aquatic animals are exposed to an effluent to determine if the effluent harms the animals. " +
          "I conducted eight experiments using the organism Daphnia magna. I added oxygenated, dechlorinated water to sample containers, " +
          "then added varying concentrations of motor oil. For each experiment, two replicates were prepared. " +
          "To each sample, I added Daphnia magna and then recorded the number of organisms alive after 24 and 48 hours. " +
          "Great care was taken to properly maintain the Daphnia magna culture for the experiments. I maintained optimal temperature and lighting and followed the appropriate schedule for feeding and water changes. " +
          "I initially tested motor oil concentrations of 0.2% and higher. When all the Daphnia magna neonates died, I conducted two experiments using NaCl, " +
          "since their response to NaCl is known. When the Daphnia magna reacted as expected, I continued the experiments, eventually using motor oil concentrations as low as 0.00017%. " +
          "Using data from Replicate #1 Experiment #8 24-hour observations, I was able to generate a graph which revealed a motor oil LC50 of 30 mg/l. " +
          "This is the concentration at which 50% of the organisms die. This very low concentration confirms how only a little bit of oil can cause serious damage to the environment.",
